# Network
Server.java implements a multithreaded server for handling multiple client connections and messaging. The server listens on a specified port via ServerSocket and waits for clients to connect. The server maintains two key data structures: the writers collection stores the output stream of all clients and allows the server to broadcast messages to all connected clients. The handler class implements the Runnable interface and represents the processing logic for each client connection. It reads the message sent by the client and broadcasts it to all other clients.

Client.java implements client logic for connecting to the server and sending and receiving messages. The client establishes a connection with the server through Socket and communicates with the server using input and output streams.
There are two main threads: one that reads the userâ€™s input and sends it to the server, and the other that continuously receives messages from the server and prints them to the console. In order to achieve real-time user interaction, the client does not need to wait for the server's response before sending a message to the server.
