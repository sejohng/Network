Server.java implements a mul,-threaded server for handling mul,ple client connec,ons and message delivery. The server listens to a specified port through ServerSocket and waits for the client’s connec,on. The server maintains two key data structures: Set<String> userNames and Set<PrintWriter> writers. userNames is used to ; the writers collec,on stores the output streams of all clients, allowing the server to broadcast messages to all connected clients. The Handler class implements the Runnable interface and represents the processing logic for each client connec,on. It reads messages sent by clients and broadcasts them to all other clients.

Client.java implements client logic for connec,ng to the server and sending and receiving messages. The client establishes a connec,on with the server through Socket and communicates with the server using input and output streams.
There are two main threads: one that reads the user’s input and sends it to the server, and the other that con,nuously receives messages from the server and prints them to the console. In order to achieve real-,me user interac,on, the client does not need to wait for the server's response before sending a message to the server.
